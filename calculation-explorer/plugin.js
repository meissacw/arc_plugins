 * block navigates first (§2.12, measured). A link into a cell is read from here.
 *
 * Top level on purpose, and prefixed: Arc concatenates every plugin's plugin.js

 *
 * One version, in one place. It used to be repeated in each registration, which

    * traced cell feeds, and each one carries a **`Fed` boolean** -- the
    * server's own tick, and the only place either feeder call says whether a
    * named cell is actually reached. It arrives **by default**, because the
    * request carries no top-level `$select` (the structural-property behaviour
    * §5a.11 turned on its head for `Components`): measured on
    * `Store Cost :: Americas | Department Store | Average Monthly Revenue |
    * Full Size Store | Franchise Store | DATA`, two entries, both `Fed: true`.
    *
    * **Three states, not two.** `true` is fed, `false` is a cell a feeder
    * statement names that nothing actually reaches -- the thing worth seeing,
    * because a rule value there reads as zero -- and **anything else is
    * `null`, "not reported", never "not fed"**. That distinction is item 36's
    * lesson: a mark the reader takes for a data fact may only be shown where
    * the datum was actually read.
    *
    * The fallback path is why `labelled` exists. When the expanded request is
    * refused the plugin re-asks without it, and a fed cell then arrives as
    * **`{ "Fed": true }` and nothing else** -- measured, same cell. The old
    * `feederLabel` dumped that object through `angular.toJson`, so every row
    * on the fallback path read `{"Fed":true}`. An unlabelled row now says so
    * in words and keeps its tick, which is the half the server did send.
    *
    * `members` pairs the tuple with the cube's dimension names the way
    * `coordinateLabel` does, and for the same reason: the names are what make
    * a six-member row readable. A tuple that does not match the dimension list
    * (a fed cell in another cube whose dimensions were never read) keeps its
    * elements in server order with no dimension claimed against them.

    * §4l: a node can come back carrying its *components'* statements as well as
    * its own, and its own is not reliably first — one cell of the demo model
    * (`Gross Margin Calculation`, New Store Opening (hide)) answers with **ten**,
    * nine of them the link cube's rule and the node's own last. Reading
    * `statements[0]` therefore shows a foreign formula as if it were the cell's,
    * which is the sharpest hazard §4l records and the reason backlog 2 was
    * called delicate.
    *
    * The discriminator is exact rather than heuristic: a `!dimension` reference
    * inside a rule always names a dimension of the **rule's own cube**, even
    * where it sits inside a DB( ) reading another one. A statement naming a
    * dimension this node's cube does not have cannot be this node's rule.
    *
    * It is written as a *keep* test and not a *drop* test, deliberately. A
    * dimension name holding a character the reference scanner stops at would be
    * read short; dropping on that would hide the right statement, while keeping
    * on it merely fails to promote it and the whole set falls back to what was
    * shown before. The worst case is therefore today's behaviour, not a worse

    * That makes the parse exact rather than a guess, and the reason is worth

    * `%7C`, `%3A` — checked in the running app, not assumed). So **every literal

    *
    * Both `,` and `|` are accepted as the part separator: the first cell seen
    * this way was read as pipe separated and the second is comma separated, and
    * since both characters are escaped inside names, accepting either costs
    * nothing.
    *
    * Two earlier versions of this got it wrong in instructive ways. Reading the
    * parts as bare element names sent TM1 an element called
    * `Retailers:Department Store`. Splitting only on `|` made a comma separated
    * handover unreadable — which at least *declined* instead of tracing the
    * wrong cell, and put the raw string in the paste box where it could be read.
    *
    * A bare positional list (`El1|El2|El3` in cube dimension order, no colons)
    * is still accepted, since a hand-written URL can carry one.

    * a `Function` naming some other action, a `State` that is not `Run`, an

    * of the most expensive call this plugin makes, and a guard that turns a
    * permissions difference into "you cannot trace" is worse than the hole it
    * closes.
    *
    * There is one code path and no permission handling, deliberately (§5a.8):
    * an administrator sees every thread and a non-admin only their own, and
    * the same request simply returns fewer rows. The consequence, which is
    * easy to get backwards: for a non-admin the absence of another user's walk
    * is **not** evidence there isn't one, so nothing built on this may ever
    * state the negative.
    *
    * Three deliberate silences, each of them a case where saying something
    * would mean guessing:
    *
    *  - **no current user name** (an unreadable /ActiveUser) -> nothing is
    *    reported at all, rather than every walk being reported as somebody
    *    else's. The reload case (§5a.8) is the user's *own* walk and is the
    *    common one, so guessing "another user" would be a lie in the case
    *    that happens most.
    *  - **a thread with no readable `Name`** -> skipped, for the same reason:
    *    own and other are not interchangeable messages, and without a name
    *    neither of them can be told honestly.
    *  - **an `ElapsedTime` that cannot be read** -> skipped. Both messages are
    *    built around "started Ns ago", and a walk the page cannot describe is
    *    not one to interrupt somebody over. `state.tracing` still covers the
    *    common case inside one page. The cost of this choice is stated plainly
    *    because it is real: if a TM1 build ever answered a duration in another
    *    form, this feature would quietly do nothing -- which is the direction
    *    that fails open.
    *
    * `mine` matches case-insensitively: TM1 user names are, and treating
    * `admin` as a different person from `Admin` would produce precisely the
    * lie above. Two people signed in as the same TM1 user are
    * indistinguishable here -- /Threads names the user, not the human -- and
    * that is accepted rather than worked around. */

             *                  still has to be able to take each hop.
             *   walkInFlight() guards the *gesture*. It reads all three, so a
             *                  grid click cannot slip into the gap a sweep
             *                  leaves between hops.
             *

             * **The cost is measured and is not the constraint.** A /Threads
             * read is 7-27 ms idle and <=41 ms in 34 of 36 in-walk samples at
             * 427 bytes, and 18 reads across a 16 s walk left no trace against

             * costs -- a runaway poll against the server this whole item
             * exists to protect would be the cure joining the disease.
             *
             * Everything here fails open, which is a requirement and not a
             * nicety: any failure of /Threads or /ActiveUser -- non-200,
             * network error, unparseable body, missing fields -- leaves

             * not build the component closure unless the closure is asked
             * for.** `$select=Value` on the cell whose tree costs 18.4 s,
             * 133 MB of payload and 416 MB of server memory it never gives
             * back returned in **14 ms and 97 bytes**; the value, the rule,
             * the type, the status, the coordinate and the cube together
             * stay under 1 KB and under 60 ms.
             *
             * So a cell click no longer buys the tree. **Every entry path
             * lands here** -- grid, typed coordinates, Arc's cell menu, a
             * pasted link, a history replay -- the reader gets the number
             * *and the rule that produced it*, with its rule-file line
             * number, and `buildTree()` is the priced second step.
             *
             * This is the first thing in this repo that **reduces** what
             * item 0 costs rather than rationing how often it is paid: the
             * common question -- which rule produced this number -- is now
             * answered with no walk at all.
             *
             * **Nothing about the walk changed.** The single claim, the
             * server pre-flight and the indicator (§4r) are all still
             * exactly where v1.10.0 left them; they now sit behind one
             * button instead of behind a click.
             *
             * **Guarded by walkInFlight() for coherence, not for cost.** A
             * preview is free, but it replaces the page's subject:
             * previewing cell Y while a tree for cell X is still streaming
             * would leave the coordinate bar naming Y and the tree naming
             * X. Refusing is also exactly what a grid click did in

             *
             * v1.11.0 split every path into a cheap preview and a priced
             * button because a tree cost the TM1 server +437 MB (§4s). v1.12.0
             * bounded the request, so the same tree is 83 KB and zero server

             *
             * **It adds no gate of its own**, and that is the point rather than
             * an omission: `previewCoordinates` is the one named-gesture path
             * (4y), and it already holds the walkInFlight/previewing refusal,
             * the visible decline, the single claim and the walkbar. Four
             * consecutive releases shipped a gesture that reached a walk around
             * the side of all that -- the grid (4o), the per-node Resolve
             * (5a.12), the frontier twisty (v1.12.0) and the operand chip (item
             * 36) -- so a tenth one growing its own is the failure mode, not the
             * missing feature. The button carries ng-disabled as well, because a
             * gate in the function alone still invites the click.
             *
             * The depth it re-runs at is `state.depth`, which the spinner beside
             * it writes: that is the whole point of the pair. `traceCoordinates`
             * reads `requestedDepth()` when it builds the query, so nothing has
             * to be passed.
             *
             * **The confirmation is gated on the raise, not on the gesture**,
             * and that division is the finding rather than a preference.
             * `CALCEXPLORER_PREVIEWCOST` -- the one paragraph on this page that
             * carries the measured depth curve -- lives under `ng-if="preview"`,
             * and this toolbar lives under `ng-if="trace"`, so the two are never
             * on screen together. At the moment this button is clicked the only
             * cost statement in reach is its own tooltip, while the spinner
             * beside it goes to 12. So a re-trace ABOVE the depth the tree on
             * screen was built at says the price first, in `DRILLCONFIRM`'s
             * register; a re-trace at the same depth or shallower is the common
             * path -- re-running after an edit, coming back down -- and stays
             * modal-free, because a prompt on every click is furniture and
             * teaches the reader to dismiss the one that matters.
             *
             * `stats.boundDepth` is what the tree was built at (`normalizeTree`
             * stamps it from `requestedDepth()`), and `requestedDepth()` is what
             * the walk will actually ask for -- the clamped value, not raw
             * `state.depth`, or the prompt would quote a number the request is
             * not going to use.
             *
             * The source label has a key of its own rather than borrowing the
             * button's, which is `CALCEXPLORER_OPERANDSOURCE`'s arrangement: the
